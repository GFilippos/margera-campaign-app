# Margera Campaign Monitor Api Web App

This Next 15 project is the requested app for margera utilizing campaign monitor api. It adheres to best practices and coding principles, while also following the guidelines provided.

I have used Next 15 alongside Typescript, TailwindCSS, REST API, Zod, and shadcn/ui for the app development. Also Postman for api testing.

You can find a guide on the homepage on how to use the simple web app.
